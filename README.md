# React + Vite
 

Pok√©mon Deck

A sleek, modern web application for browsing and searching Pok√©mon. Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, this project features a dynamic user interface with smooth animations and robust error handling.

(Note: Replace this with an actual screenshot or GIF of your application.)

‚ú® Features

Dynamic Pok√©mon Fetching: Loads a list of 300 Pok√©mon from the Pok√©API on initial load.

Live Search: Instantly filter the Pok√©mon list in real-time by typing in the search bar.

Responsive Design: A fully responsive grid layout that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

Modern UI/UX:

A beautiful dark theme with a subtle animated aurora background.

Gradient text for the main heading.

3D perspective on the card grid, allowing for interactive 3D card effects (implemented in the Card component).

Robust Error Handling:

Global Error State: Displays a user-friendly error message with a "Try Again" button if the initial data fetch fails.

Component-Level Error Boundary: Each Pok√©mon card is wrapped in an ErrorBoundary. If a single card fails to render (e.g., due to malformed API data), it will be replaced by an error message with a "Retry" button, preventing the entire application from crashing.

Loading State: Shows a clean loading spinner while fetching the Pok√©mon data to inform the user of background activity.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Hooks: (useState, useEffect) for state management and side effects in functional components.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Pok√©API: The free and open-source Pok√©mon RESTful API used for all data.

Key Components

main.js:

Manages the application's global state (pokemon list, loading status, errors, and search query).

Handles fetching all Pok√©mon data from the Pok√©API.

Filters the Pok√©mon based on the user's search input.

Renders the main layout, header, search bar, and the grid of Pok√©mon cards.

Includes the ErrorBoundary class component.

card.js (Required Dependency):

This component is responsible for displaying the details of a single Pok√©mon.

It receives the Pok√©mon data and its index as props (data, index).

This is likely where any 3D hover effects or specific card styling would be implemented.

ErrorBoundary.js:

A simple React class component designed to catch JavaScript errors in its child component tree.

When an error is caught, it displays a fallback UI with a "Retry" button, which allows the user to attempt to re-render the child component. This is used to gracefully handle potential rendering issues with individual cards.

üôè Credits

This project would not be possible without the incredible Pok√©API for providing all the Pok√©mon data.
